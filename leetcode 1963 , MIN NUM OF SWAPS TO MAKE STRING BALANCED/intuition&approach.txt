Intuition

1-none of the brackets are the enemy
2-the most ideal condition is an empty string , so addition of an open bracket as well as closing bracket disrupts us.

3-imagine the string is balanced till now and we get an extra closing bracket we will deal with it (this closing anomaly)
 with the opening anomaly we found till now , as we are greedy so we try to neutralize these anomalies asap so we swap the
  extra closing with the first open we saw(that was also an anomaly as each bracket techincally disrupt our ideal case
   which is empty string)

Approach

keep track of swaps req , keep track of both anomalies - extra closing or extra opening brackets ,
we can use variables - 1-openNeeded (for extra closing brackets)

2-extraOpen
when their diff is non zero we know some anomaly is getting dominant so so when lets say we get extra closing
(as soon as we get one extra closing we rush to stop it - GREEDY APPROACH)
so we swap and update variables
